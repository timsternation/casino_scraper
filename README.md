# casino_scraper

I built this script to pull some basic contact info for casinos across the US. This was inspired by a task for work where we needed a list of casinos per zip code that included all casinos in the US. It is much easier automated!

Written in Python 3, it uses bs4, urllib.request, time, and json modules. It uses the json module to write the data to a txt file.
